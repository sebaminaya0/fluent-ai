# Audio Parameter Improvements - Step 7

## Summary

This document summarizes the audio parameter improvements implemented in Step 7 to provide clearer, longer phrases with better Whisper recognition performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sample Rate Optimization
- **Set sample rate to 16 kHz** (Whisper's default) across all audio capture components
- Updated `sr.Microphone(sample_rate=16000)` in both `main_whisper.py` and `gui_app.py`
- Configured silence detector to use 16 kHz as default sample rate

### 2. Improved Chunk Size
- **Increased chunk size to 1024 frames** from default smaller values
- Updated `sr.Microphone(sample_rate=16000, chunk_size=1024)` in all audio capture points
- This reduces CPU overhead and provides better audio buffering for longer phrases

### 3. Audio Volume Normalization (RMS)
- **Added `normalize_audio_rms()` function** in both main files
- Normalizes audio volume using Root Mean Square (RMS) to target level of 0.2
- Ensures consistent volume levels for better Whisper recognition of quiet speech
- Applied before passing audio to Whisper for transcription

### 4. Automatic Gain Control (AGC)
- **Added `apply_automatic_gain_control()` function** in both main files
- Provides gentle compression to reduce dynamic range
- Applies mild gain boost for quiet speech (up to 2x gain factor)
- Improves consistency across different microphones and environments

### 5. Enhanced Audio Processing Pipeline
- Audio now goes through the following pipeline before Whisper transcription:
  1. Raw audio capture at 16 kHz with 1024 frame chunks
  2. RMS normalization to target 0.2 level
  3. Automatic gain control for consistency
  4. Write processed audio to temporary file for Whisper

## Code Changes

### main_whisper.py
- Added `normalize_audio_rms()` function
- Added `apply_automatic_gain_control()` function
- Updated `grabar_y_reconocer_con_whisper()` to use optimized microphone settings
- Updated audio processing pipeline to apply normalization and AGC

### gui_app.py
- Added `normalize_audio_rms()` method to FluentAIGUI class
- Added `apply_automatic_gain_control()` method to FluentAIGUI class
- Updated `record_and_process()` to use optimized microphone settings
- Updated `process_with_whisper()` to apply audio processing

### silence_detector.py
- Updated default sample rate to 16000 Hz (Whisper optimized)
- Added chunk_size parameter with default 1024 frames
- Enhanced documentation for audio parameter optimization

## Benefits

1. **Better Speech Recognition**: 16 kHz sample rate matches Whisper's training data
2. **Reduced CPU Overhead**: Larger chunk sizes (1024 frames) reduce processing overhead
3. **Improved Quiet Speech**: RMS normalization ensures quiet speech is properly amplified
4. **Microphone Consistency**: AGC provides consistent behavior across different microphones
5. **Longer Phrase Support**: Optimized buffering allows for better capture of longer phrases

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with different microphones to verify AGC effectiveness
2. Test with quiet speech to verify RMS normalization
3. Test with long phrases to ensure no audio dropouts
4. Monitor CPU usage to verify reduced overhead
5. Compare transcription accuracy before and after changes

## Configuration

The audio improvements are enabled by default but can be customized:

- **Target RMS level**: Default 0.2, adjustable in `normalize_audio_rms()`
- **AGC gain factor**: Max 2.0x, adjustable in `apply_automatic_gain_control()`
- **Sample rate**: 16000 Hz (Whisper optimal)
- **Chunk size**: 1024 frames (performance optimal)

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing code. The audio processing functions include error handling to gracefully fall back to original audio if processing fails.
